# Urban-Tech-
Description: Our project is called The Golden State Project and it is named after our very own city of San Francisco. Our inspiration comes from Dan Luscher's 15-Minute City Project where every UrbanTech service is accessible within a radius of 15 minutes. Our project intends to take USF as a central point in which we fostered 9 different public services which are accessible to our fellow Dons within a 15 minute radius. 

Why: Our main goal is to promote the idea of sustainability by limiting the amount of carbon emissions by encouraging students to walk to their destinations. 

How To: Our website has two main pages, the first being the home page which then redirects the user to our second page which is an interactive-map. By clicking the "San Francisco" button on the home page, the user is able to access the different services labeled on the map. The user is able to click on the location markers which have a link to the respective website service. By clicking on the blue lines, the user is able to see the time it takes to walk from USF to the respective UrbanTech service.

Future Implementation: We would like to host it globally once we implement the following features. We want to expand to various college campuses in order to give everyone the same experience as our fellow Dons. We would also like to implement a Google Maps Distance API in order to have a quicker development process rather than manually entering all the coordinates for the destinations. 

Sidenotes: We did use the Google Maps Distance API originally and it worked locally, but we were not able to host it as a webapp on Glitch and PythonAnywhere. So now our website utilizes Folium which as mentioned above requires the developer to manually enter the coordinates.
